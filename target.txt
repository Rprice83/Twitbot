Hmm no, CBS This Morning was the first place I saw this news todayWhy isn't fox or brightbart covering this?No, they absolutely didn't.

https://news.google.com/news/search/section/q/wasserman%20schultz/wasserman%20schultz?hl=en&ned=usso by "completely ignore" you mean "cover comprehensively"? Well at least Fox is going ballsdeep on this conspiracy right now... and it's not even Hannity doing it... just played the video of DWS getting mighty pissy with capitol police over the laptop that made it to the front page here a couple months back. 

Paraphrasing - "This conspiracy is not just for right-wing pizzagaters anymore..." The arrest will not be televised...the arrest wasn't supposed to happen and it wasn't in the script. Simply, it makes the anti-Trump MSM and their masters look bad in comparision.Another thread brigaded to all fuck with conspiracy users having their posts removed. [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wasserman-schultz-fires-staffer-fraud-arrest-48857862)

[NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651)Forget about them covering it now that trump tweeted about transgendered people in the military. That will be the "big news" now I bet, and this dws it story will be swept under the rug..

Horrible timing if you ask me. Or maybe a calculated distraction?Shocking that a member of her team would be arrested for fraud.  She seems like such an upstanding and ethical politician. SNORE.Didn't he get arrested for just lying on his loan application that he wasn't renting out his home when he really was? Am I missing something? I know he also sent the loan money to Pakistan, but how does that connect him to any conspiracy? Of course they did. They haven't reported real news in almost a year. If Trump's son ever talks to a Russian person you'll know about it though. You'll hear about it for about three straight weeks actually. Give me a break man. The entire reason Trump sent that tweet was to trigger SJW outrage. Worked like a charm.Looks like ABC superficially reported it after an uncomfortably long silence: http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wasserman-schultz-fires-staffer-fraud-arrest-48857862But...but....Russia....muh Russia.....If this was any type of counter intelligence operation and not a criminal one then he would not have been let go with an ankle bracelet.I emailed Fox News about this and no response. Funny though... The transgender thing is front page news. HA! F-ing ridiculous... But guys who want to chop their dicks off and join the military got their fee fees hurt.  That's MUCH more important.  But Russia. 

If the mainstream wanted they would harp on the DNC all day long like do trump with the Russia narrative, but they don't. I would've arrested him from Day 1, along with Wasserman-Schultz. Probably because no one cares, he's been waiting on an investigation outcome for months and everyone knows he was guilty already, this isn't exactly a surprise. [The revolution will not be televised.](https://youtu.be/qGaoXAwl9kw)Just because there's a story on their site doesn't mean they didn't ignore it. Nobody searches for news they don't know about, they scan the front page.Only the Politico article wasn't posted this afternoon.

Edit: seems to be gone nowI saw it on Yahoo and Reddit. I don't watch cable news though. Is CBS really pne of the big three, though? I always think of CNN, MSNBC, and the BBCCBS ain't big 3, BOY. Fox is.  

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/25/feds-arrest-it-staffer-for-wasserman-schultz-trying-to-leave-country.htmlGeraldo Rivera talked about it last night on Hannity. Now they will try and pin the DNC leaks on Awan and finally push Seth Rich under the rug with all of Hillary's other bodies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQbH5naVoEFox News Politics covered it pretty early on.

[Feds arrest IT staffer for Wasserman Schultz trying to leave country](http://archive.is/Meff2)I'm pretty sure I saw a Breitbart story on it.Links to significant coverage on Fox the evening the story broke has been tossed around many of the reddit threads. See further links in other replies to this comment.You don't watch fox do youSet the date to 7/25/17 with the Tools option, and this is first SERP (search engine results page) for '[awan arrested](https://imgur.com/a/56xrS)' and '[debbie wasserman schultz](https://imgur.com/a/r2K0L)'. still no big 3. Unless you have other queries for me to try, you're very wrong. Yeah... I saw this story on repeat on several major news channels.  Downvoted  for shit posting.  Hey care to update?>it makes the anti-Trump MSM

honestly this is such a stratch. I am living in europe and we think who ever is pro trump is clearly mentally retarded. I think you're right. I was skeptical of the bank fraud charges but it looks like those were place holder charges to justify the arrest until the other shoe drops.It wasn't supposed to happen because this idiot was not supposed to be in the country. The fact that he was in the country tells me that we are dealing with some kind of "WE GOT BIN LADEN!!!"-type fake arrest.Russia, Russia, Russia Burger is failing! [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wasserman-schultz-fires-staffer-fraud-arrest-48857862)

[NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651)> Or maybe a calculated distraction?

Definitely intentional. Trump is protecting Dems from this Awan thing. What would Trump be trying to distract from with the arrest of DWS's aide? The news is OUTRAGED that Trump would ban transgenders. They don't care about real news or corruption because they're Masters don't want it reported on.Just bad timing, but the MSM aren't *that* interested in the Awan brothers disaster.  There's a lot more involved than this one guy and Debbie WS.  

Interesting thing about that tweet - very well thought out, and it appeared written by someone else.  Not his usual gonzo tweet style.
He hasan oncurring federal investigation as well. This is why you hear the term placer charges. They didn't want him leaving the country. This can make one assume a bit, that the bank fraud charges were minimal in compared to the other investigation. They could've arrested him on that charge any time, but chose to arrest him for it while he was trying to flee the country. This appears much larger thanit looks.Almost a year? This shits been going on for decades. It didn't just start because trump ran for president. Wouldn't have been news if they didn't lie about it. All they had to do was be honest about the meeting. Hope they all(including Hilary and DWS, especially DWS) rot, but nothing will come from any of this. Well what do you think people care more about? Hey, it also affects girls who want to grow dicks and join the military. And frankly, that's exactly the kind of 'girl' you'd want in the military. The kind with facial hair and rampant testosterone.Putin, that EVIL OLIGARCH who we are NOTHING LIKE, definitely **bought her the ticket to distract from Russiagate**. It's so clear but the conservatards can't see it! I'm so woke!!!>Just because there's a story on their site doesn't mean they didn't ignore it. 

Hey just because X exists doesn't mean X exists.And watch in the comments as goalposts are shifted to 
"they didnt put it out fast enough" or to "they only put it out to not look biased!"The majority of people get their news in written form and what's this about not knowing news they don't search for? That's why people go to news websites and OP was composing about the lack of coverage. So what? "Completely ignore" vs "wasn't the quickest to publish" are completely different. the linked article is horribly biased and makes it sound like the media is willfully ignoring something because liberal agenda or whatever, when really they just didn't report on it as fast as another publication. 5 hours ago, by far the latest on the draw: http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/imran-awan-house-democrats/r/funny is --->I just came to this post from the very top of the sub. Than we gotta be in here with the proper votes to spread the truth! from first paragraph of OP: "...but NBC, CBS, and NBC completely ignored it."

edit: That is a direct quote, and yes, it says NBC twice. They mention ABC down further in the article, so I'll assume typo. Just a really dumb article all around.

The "Big Three" networks are CBS, ABC and NBCIt may not be in terms of ratings anymore, but CBS is definitely part of "the big 3" when it comes to networks. Just as the Auto industry "big three" is still Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler even though Toyota has been eating their breakfast lunch and dinner for over two decades.  

Big three refers to the national networks, and does not include cable. NBC, CBS, ABC. Fox network (over the air fox network) should be included, but since it is so much younger than the other three it is not generally included...

Also...read the first paragraph dude... 
>but NBC, CBS, and NBC completely ignored it.  


According to this article, the headlines claim of big three includes CBS...and CBS this morning covered this story...Fuck Geraldo Rivera particularly and specifically! Who knows what Awan has though.  It's not just Wasserman-Schultz - there's other congress-critters too.

Thank you, I guess I looked to early after reading about it on here when it initially broke.WOW, lunch time the next day and no mention on Drudge. Got the Transdistraction going on. Nope, just when the articles come up in my feed. I don't really watch news on TV at all anymore."Completely Ignore"

How heavy is that goalpost you're moving around?False. When it first broke it wasn't being reported anywhere except fringe independent media, and right-wing sites. I checked immediately and there was nothing on CNN, Washington Post etc.LmaoAnywhere in the world that educates their people know that. 

It's the dumpsters that believe subject matter experts and higher education is bad because it doesn't focus only on biblical science and coal mining. Clearly Why wasn't he supposed to be in the country? This Awan thing will really prove to me whether Trump is part of a New Deep State or is he just the sameDemocrats are the victims of Awan's alleged crimes. He's alleged to have defrauded them by over-charging for services, stolen equipment from them, and accessed their sensitive data improperly.

If Trump is trying to intentionally cover this story up, the *obvious* conclusion is that Trump (or someone connected to him) hired these people to illegally gain access to the offices and computer files of Democratic members of Congress.

WATERGATE 2.0???Because of how big it is. Trump relies on the horrible Democrats to appear electable. If Democrats get wiped out thanks to the media honestly covering this Awan case, Trump will be hurt politically. The Republicans NEED the corrupt Democrats, it's a symbiotic relationship. Telling 10,000-15,000 service members that they're no longer welcome to serve their country is real fucking news, as is the fact that the president would make such a monumental decision affecting so many people's lives on a whim to score political points.> Just bad timing

Are you trying to claim Trump didn't know about this Awan thing?

Or are you claiming he was stupid enough to think it would be a good idea to blast trans people and cause a bunch of controversy right now? 

Where's that 15-D chess? Explain to me how it's actually secretly smart for Trump to distract us from this with irrational bullshit. Even if you're a bigoted asshole who would literally hate-crime a trans person if you saw them, you have to recognize that generating controversy like this right now is NOT A GOOD IDEA. >This can make one assume a bit

Like the assumption that the pee pee tape exists and that the Trump campaign collaborated with Russian intelligence?

We can all "assume" things. You're missing the point It's actually funny with all this Awan fluff. 

Can't wait until midnight tonight when WH Anon is suddenly forgotten! You're welcome to assume that these news agencies didn't hear about the news as it was breaking, or made a good faith decision to not cover the story until the morning. 

I would argue that that's stupid, and they're only publishing stories now that they realize they're unable to ignore it. [Here's](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDIA_BREAKING_NEWS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-07-24-10-53-35) an AP article discussing the current 'news wars', and prevalence of recent stories that broke in the evening. As of the time of publishing the article OP linked, it's claims were 100% accurate. So what? You're posting something to try and prove the OP wrong even though the articles you cite were posted AFTER the OP, therefore they do not disprove their point.

OP's submission is over 6 hours old whereas the articles you have sourced are essentially 2 or 3 hours old and the arrest happened further back than that. or

 - *oh fuck there is a buzz on internet about us ignoring this news, quick write something about it*> the linked article is horribly biased and makes it sound like the media is willfully ignoring something because liberal agenda or whatever, when really they just didn't report on it as fast as another publication. 

And they aren't giving this huge story nearly the attention it deserves.

Just because they have a single story on it doesn't mean they're covering it fairly.Ahhh come on if this was Trump it would have been up as soon as the cuffs were locked Hmm, guess if you report things it removes the article from your view?  I can't see it anymore. It's gone now.  I just reported it and it was taken down after a few minutes. Oh i see. I didnt see NBC mentionedVERY Fake NOOSFrankly I'd be shocked if it *wasn't* in terms of ratings as well. Of the big three, as I am aware, CBS has been top dog for a long time Also, I don't think the Fox over air network has national news. I could be wrong, I don't watch a lot of broadcast TV.He did kind of expose the opium fields the us military were protecting in Afghanistan though.He got it backwards too. He said Debbie and the DNC were favoring Bernie, not Hillary. I assume he just misspoke. Remember Seth.I am shocked by this!1. The OP is about how the big 3 ignored the story initially.  
2. You post a garbage link to google news asserting that this is incorrect.  
3. I post screengrabs of the results google displayed that day for the same subjects you searched.  
4. Nothing from big 3 shows up. 
5. You accuse me of moving goalposts. 
6. I laugh at you. That's a long shot from "completely ignored".Higher education is a cesspool of post-modern, Marxist critical theory. This is the reason for all the safe spaces and calling everyone who isn't currently sucking Bernie's dick a literal Nazi. This isn't merely the opinion of the under-educated and indoctrinated. Even major professors who agree with your politics are coming out and talking about how bad academia is getting. You seriously don't see anything wrong with situations like Evergreen?

You're displaying a very disgusting attitude of self-righteous elitism, assuming that everyone that disagrees with you is some backwater, ignorant hick who's never opened a science textbook. The irony is, it's people who think like you do that caused Trump to win the election in the first place. People are sick of the holier-than-thou, everyone-is-dumber-than-me attitude from the left.The "story" was that he fled to Pakistan. Why he didn't already actually do that before the alternative media started covering this story I do not know.Wha-What? You think Trump is, like, afraid of a third party sprouting up overnight and unseating him?**The corrupt Republicans NEED the corrupt Democrats** FTFY

They're symbiotic. Both parties are dirty. Both need one another. There are 15,000 transgender service members? That sounds pretty high...So that's more important than an espionage ring that has infiltrated both parties in Congress including intelligence committees which may have led to AQ and ISIS being tipped off prior to raids? You're concern for transgenders in the military is kind of a moot point if the Military intelligence that is supposed to keep them safe has been compromised.Why do you keep coming back here bombthrow?  Go ahead say something about my safe space and then delete it 10 seconds later.preeeeeachOf the two choices given, I picked bad timing, but thank you for assuming I'm a stupid bigoted asshole.

If were' going with that argument, here's what that (rather good!) AP article is mostly referencing:
"Last Wednesday saw a succession of stories breaking after 6:30 p.m.: News about another effort to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, President Trump's son and son-in-law compelled to testify before Congress and Sen. John McCain diagnosed with cancer. Into this, the Times dropped its startling interview with the president expressing regret at appointing his attorney general. So much for the show that Denis Horgan, executive producer of MSNBC's "All In with Chris Hayes," had spent hours preparing."

Here's what Imran Awan, an aide to a democratic congresswoman did:
"Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents." Before attempting to leave the country, presumably to follow his wife and kids who fled earlier. Newsworthy? Yes. On par with everything the AP article is talking about? Don't think many people would agree with that. 

I do see your point tho. Some stories get so big they can't be ignored, even if they're completely retarded, like how Trump eats his steak with ketchup or whatever because the news gains so much traction on social media and everyone is talking about it and there's this ridiculous competition. But this "media blackout" phrase is a familiar right-wing spin on so many damned things it shouldn't be trusted. Gotta love the arguing in circles in the comments over a shitty post.  Except the stories were out yesterday, several were linked here in the 22 threads about it that made it to the front page, and this wasn't the only subreddit talking about it.Maybe OP should chill the fuck out then. WaPo Editor: "Information Liberation.com is tearing us to pieces!! Get on the red phone and tell Hills we can't squash this story any longer. Yes, yes the reporter will have to die, you think this is my first rodeo son?!?" *Oh shit /r/conspiracy is onto us, quick let's write an article to throw them off our tail.*

Like that?Why do you think this is a huge story? Well, yes, because Trump is the goddamn president.Perhaps? I had never see the post before I made that comment, so it was definitely there within the minute I replied to you and still is as far as I can see. Yeah reporting hides the post, you can go to your profile and there should be an option to see hidden posts, at least that's how it works in the reddit is fun app. No reddit just hides things you report. It is still at the top. If you go to the hidden tab of you profile you can unhide it.You're probably right, but I did zero research and I'm not sure if the national networks still hold top ratings when it comes to news. I assume the cable news networks have eaten away at their ratings over the years.I think they only have Sunday morning programs that cover national news, but yeah... When it comes to television news the big 3 are CBS, NBC, ABC.Those pesky opium fields!Post says completely ignore.  There are clear results showing they aren't.  You claim new constraints to the word "completely"

But no chief, you're REALLY showing me!  Hooo boyThis topic wasn't created saying "THIS WILL NEVER EVER CHANGE" it was just describing what was happening when it was posted early in the day. You shouldn't be surprised that things can change over time, that's usually how things work. Agreed- Crunchy school of less 5,000 students has some dumbass faculty = national epidemic. How could it not be our nations greatest tragedy, I heard about it on Joe Rogan!?Yeah, getting taken by a conman and having regret afterwards sure was a good way to prove how smart they were.Thanks for proving my point. His brothers fled a few months ago. His wife left on an earlier flight than she was supposed to. He didn't try to leave the country until Tuesday. This is fucking fascinating fiction. Different studies have different estimates, but that's the range.  It's around a percent of active-duty soldiers, compared to transgendered people being about 0.3 percent of the population as a whole.  I've read that minorities and groups that feel social oppression tend to gravitate towards government jobs and the military, because they have decent job security and pay, and strict rules about discrimination, so transgendereds have a disproportionate population in active service.  (One of the first places in the US to have racial integration was the Army)Given that the thing I said is real and the thing you said is made up, yes.>Why do you keep coming back here bombthrow?

1) Because it's a conspiracy sub, and I have a strong interest in what might be one of the biggest conspiracies in modern American history -- the president of the United States potentially selling out his country to a foreign adversary;

2) Because outside of The_Donald nonsense I'm happy not engaging on threads here about things I find outlandish or offensive (9/11 Truth, anti-Semitic posts, lizard people, UFO stuff, etc.) because it's not my place to get on people's cases about that kinda stuff in a sub dedicated to it;

3) Because even if I don't believe in a particular conspiracy theory I still find it interesting to lurk and see what people are saying -- and as MKULTRA and the Tuskegee Experiments show, sometimes unbelievable things turn out to be true;

4) Because despite impressions, and again outside the T_D invasion forces, it's often easier to engage with people here and have interesting discussions, even when they disagree with you; 

5) Because it's not healthy to spend *all* your time in circle-jerks of folks who already agree with you; and

6) Because I'm a goddamned American and I'll visit whatever subs I fucking please thank you very much.The article was linked to indicate that the time of day when the story broke has nothing to do with whether or not it was covered. 24/7 cycle and all that. Controlling narratives is as much about what you don't talk about as whatever bullshit you're trying to signal boost. http://izquotes.com/quotes-pictures/quote-it-s-plain-hokum-if-you-can-t-convince-em-confuse-em-it-s-an-old-political-trick-but-this-harry-s-truman-187102.jpgThen link them, I'm replying to what was posted big guy. if its being talked about on r conspiracy - it is being talked about on other social sites and forums. 

things circulate fast through internet.

Exactly like that.Do you really not understand why?The big three still top the cable networks. ABC, NBC, then CBS is the usual order for the evening news.

And on cable MSNBC actually beat Fox every night last week. edit, it looks like they've been managing to beat Fox and CNN quite often since May and that was the first time since 2000.I'll refer you back to my very first comments in this thread, specifically on the timing of posts.

> As of the time of publishing the article OP linked, it's claims were 100% accurate.  

Have any new searches for me to try that actually follow the criteria, or do you realize that you'll just keep being wrong? I never said or implied anything you just said.  I agree, things do change ar a glacier pace.Except there's a reason why anybody gives a shit which is that the assumption is that they're trying to keep this out of the public's view. The reading between the lines on this is not *"Major news outlet somewhat slower than others to report, which literally makes no difference and why am I even saying this!?!?"* it's *"Major news trying to squash story at the behest of DNC puppetmasters!"*

If everybody upvoting this post assumed we'd see a dozen major stories about it literally with 18 or 24 hours, why do any of you give a shit? There is ZERO truth to your 15,000 statement. That's odd. I never see you chime in on the conspiracies you say you're interested in, only the "T_D nonsense", as you put it. Why is that?What?Lol this seems to be the main tactic rather than plan B.  Look at your own subreddit, and maybe stop taking gossip as fact.>if its being talked about on r conspiracy - it is being talked about on other social sites and forums. 

Here, some frog-avatar Twitter accounts, and maybe the comment section on Mike Cernovich's blog.

Really important places.


LmaoNo. The post on your 9 hr old submission?   And yknow, again, "completely ignores"

Cmon, I have faith you can come up with some more criteria for "completely ignores"Here's the [UCLA study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-Military-Service-May-2014.pdf) that came up with the estimate of 15,500 active duty transgendered troops.  Feel free to critique their methodology if you like. Other groups have other estimates; the RAND Corporation estimated there was about half this number. 

The precise number isn't super important to me, more the fact that a draft dodger who knows nothing about duty or service is declaring that thousands of Americans can't serve their country just to score some political points with bigots.https://imgur.com/f9FW2**Controlling narratives is as much about what you don't talk about as whatever bullshit you're trying to signal boost.** https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6pnvf0/big_three_networks_completely_ignore_arrest_of/dkrmyrg/

u/gimpbully is the best. proving him wrong is moving goalposts. You made the claim, back it up like you're capable of rational thought. A congressional IT aide (to many members of congress and one party committee) with access to top secret information commits fraud, and you don't see how this is a huge story?The fuck are you even talking about? I am not OP, which should be obvious, but w/e.  

When the article we're all discussing n this thread was published, there was 0 content from the major networks on the story - they ignored it. I don't understand why this is so fucking confusing for you. 

You then posted links to articles from today to assert the falshood of the premise of the article we're discussing in this thread. As a reply, I posted screengrabs of google results for searches on the subject, which are actually from that day. If the content you claim exists actually existed at the time, it would have been present in the results. I love people who claim there's "ZERO truth" for something will just ignore evidence that contradicts their worldview. UCLA, lmao.

That's the equivalent of arguing for creationism and linking to a paper from Brigham Young University.

edit: bring on the downvotes facists! hide the truth that inconveniences you.I get that, but he didn't address anything else I said...ugh, forget it. Being a link monkey for a person unwilling to read the 20+ other threads on this topic currently in this subreddit has nothing to do with ability to form rational thought.

And neither is believing gossip.  Look for yourself.You literally explained nothing in this post. You simply reasserted the situation and said "See? See? Can't you see?" like that crazy person in the South Park 9/11 conspiracy episode.Hey man, sure, "your post on a 9hr old submission"

Mobile highlights your name like it's OP, my mistake.

Completely ignore 

To your edit: no, I get it, it's "completely ignored" up until a precise time when it no longer counts.  The conspiracy only exists until someone hits publish.UCLA is a fine research institution, and is the top-tier of the public schools of the US.

Just because you got your masters degree from reddit doesn't mean that you get to now determine which school's research is valid and which isn'tWhat? No it is not. Uh, what "truth" are you trying to prove here? UCLA is a school in which nobody should trust for its scientific findings?Can you point out any flaws in the study's methodology? Because it was nonsequtor trash that missed the point of the link in the first place. I ignored it because it wasn't worth addressing. [removed]I think what he is saying is that the article in the OP says that the big 3 didn't cover it, not that it wasn't covered at all. At the time the OP was published, it was indeed not covered by the big 3, although in the time since then, they have begun to cover it. I hope that makes sense now. How did that explain nothing? The points are:

This guy had access to tons of top secret information.

He was the IT guy for around a dozen people in congress.

He committed fraud.

That is huge. The implications of what he could do with the information he knows (or what he already did) are basically limitless.How did that explain nothing? The points are:

Don't whine about edits when you've edited 100% of your posts in this thread. "Cmon..." It is an enormously stupid interpretation, but at this point that's to be expected. "They picked up on the story almost 24 hours late after being unable to ignore coverage so they totally didn't ignore it!!!!! Isn't CBS great?!" I'm sorry, I have my master's from a much more prestigious institution than reddit. And yes, I don't believe the 15,000 number. At all. Scientific? An estimate is now science? Models are now science?Yes, they ball park .3% when the national average is under .1%.
